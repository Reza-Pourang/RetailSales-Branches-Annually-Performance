# RetailSales-Branches-Annually-Performance

## Overview  

Retail businesses generate vast amounts of sales data across different branches. Analyzing this data can reveal valuable insights into **customer trends, seasonal variations, and top-performing products**.  

This project performs **data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on **branch-level retail sales data** to uncover key business insights.  

## Project Workflow  

The analysis consists of **two main steps**:  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load and clean the dataset.  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.  
   - Rename and select relevant columns for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze unique customers across different states.  
   - Identify **top-performing states** based on customer count.  
   - Study **monthly and seasonal sales trends**.  
   - Visualize data using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.  

## Dataset Details  

The dataset contains sales records from multiple branches, including:  

- **State**: Location of the branch.  
- **MonthNumeric**: Numeric representation of months.  
- **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.  
- **VisitorName**: Sales representative assigned.  
- **ProductName & ProductGroup**: Product details.  
- **Cartons**: Number of cartons sold.  
- **NetSales**: Revenue generated.  

## Key Insights  

- The **top states** in terms of unique customers were identified.  
- Monthly sales trends revealed **peak sales months**.  
- Seasonal analysis showed **which periods drive the most revenue**.  
- Visualizations helped highlight **branch performance variations**.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
